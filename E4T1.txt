# Prevent SSH brute force attacks

## Remove Allow password authentication

    Log into the machine and alter the /etc/ssh/sshd_config settings. Change
    the PasswordAuthentication setting to no. THis will prevent any SSH attempts
    in using the username and password to log into the system.

## Change SSH port

    The access port for SSH can be changed to a different port. This creates a 
    layer of obfuscation removing the ability of an attacker to easily guess
    the SSH port to try a brute force attack.

## Limit SSH users

    Change the SSH configuration file to only allow certain users to user SSH
    to log into the system
