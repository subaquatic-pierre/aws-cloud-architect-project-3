# Private subnet has internet Gateway attached:
    
    The private subnet should not have an internet gateway assigned to the routing table and associated with the private subnet. If the subnet needs
    public access it should use an internet gateway.

# Web App security group

    The security group assigned to the web application instance should only allow traffic from the internet facing load balancer. It should only 
    allow access on port 443, not 80 and 5000. Using TLS / SSL encrypted connection ensures data transferred between the client and the server is 
    encrypted thus preventing anyone who is packet sniffing to have access to the data.

# IAM Instance Role permissions:

    The IAM role used for for instance profile role is overly permissive. It currently allows S3 actions on any buckets. The role should be 
    restricted to only read and write permissions to the specific buckets in use for the application.

# S3 Bucket Encryption and Versioning:

    The S3 buckets should have versioning control enabled for all objects uploaded to the bucket. This ensures that if an attacker was 
    to gain access to delete or alter files on the bucket it is able to be restored. All data uploaded to the bucket should be encrypted by default.

# S3 Bucket VPC endpoint

    Because the web server instance is requesting data from the buckets all objects uploaded to the bucket should be marked as private. 
    The bucket should not be publicly accessible. A VPC endpoint should be used to allow access from only the web server.
